Welcome to Team0 Nebula, here you can publish your Hytale server onto out public server list, get new players, manage a newsletter, manage marketing and so much more.

## Before we start you'll need:

- A Hytale server. You can see how to start a server [here](/how-to-start-a-server).
- A Team0 Nebula Account. Log in here. (TODO: ADD LOG IN LINK)

<Note>
  In order to show your server's status you need to install [HyQuery](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyquery) first.
</Note>

<CreateServer />

There all you need to do is put your _server's display name_ (thats the name shown in the server list) and select Hytale in the <Icon icon="gamepad" /> **Game **Dropdown. Then input the server adress, game version, and the slug.
