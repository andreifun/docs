Welcome to Team0 Nebula. Here, you can publish your Hytale server on our public server listing, attract new players, manage a newsletter, and much more.

## Before you start, you need

- A Hytale server. You can see how to start a server [here](/how-to-start-a-server).
- A Team0 Nebula account. Log in here. (TODO: ADD LOG IN LINK)

<Note>
  To show your server status, install [HyQuery](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyquery) first.
